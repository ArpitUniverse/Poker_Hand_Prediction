# Poker Hand Prediction

This project is designed to predict the outcome of poker hands based on a dataset of card combinations. It uses machine learning techniques to classify poker hands, such as straight flush, full house, and four of a kind.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately predicts the poker hand type from a set of card features. The dataset includes various combinations of card suits and ranks, which are used to classify hands into predefined categories.

## Contents

1. **Step 1: Importing Libraries**
   - Key Python libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib` are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Step 2: Loading the Dataset**
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas` and contains information on different poker hands, with columns representing the card values and suits.

3. **Step 3: Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps (not yet detailed) are performed to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.

4. **Step 4: Model Building**
   - Machine learning models such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks (to be specified) are trained on the data to predict the poker hand types.

5. **Step 5: Model Evaluation**
   - The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of 25,009 rows and 11 columns, with each row representing a different poker hand combination. The columns correspond to the rank and suit of five cards, and the target column contains the classification of the hand.
